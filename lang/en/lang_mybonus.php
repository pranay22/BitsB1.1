  Karma Bonus Point... <br />If you save up enough of them, you can trade them in for goodies like bonus GB(s) to 
  your upload<br /> stats,getting more invites, or doing the real Karma booster... give them to another user!<br />
  and yes! this is awarded on a per torrent basis (max of 5) even if there are no leechers on the Torrent you are seeding! <br />
  <h1>Other things that will get you karma points : </h1>
  - Uploading a new torrent = 15 points
  <br />- Putting up an offer = 10 points**
  <br />- Filling a request = 50 points
  <br />- Comment on torrent = 3 points
  <br />- Saying thanks = 2 points
  <br />- Rating a torrent = 2 points
  <br />- Making a post = 1 point
  <br />- Starting a topic = 2 points 
  <br />
  <h1>Some things that will cost you karma points:</h1>
  <br />- Upload credit
  <br />- Custom title
  <br />- A 1:1 ratio on a torrent
  <br />- Getting extra invite
  <br />- Giving a gift of karma points to another user
  <br />- Asking for a re-seed**
  <br />- Making a request**
  <br />- But keep in mind that everything that can get
  you karma can also be lost, <br />ie : if you up a torrent then delete it, you will gain and then lose 15 points, <br />
  making a post and having it deleted will do the same<br /><br />... and there are other hidden bonus karma points all 
  over the site.<br /><br />Yet another way to help out your ratio! 
  <br />- *please note, staff can give or take away 
  points for breaking the rules, or doing good for the community.
  <br />- **Yet to be implemented
